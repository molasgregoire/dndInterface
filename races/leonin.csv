Attitude


1
I'm amused by the antics of the gods and their earnest, but ultimately deluded, mortal champions, and I feel smugly superior in my detachment.


2
The meddling of the gods in mortal affairs makes me angry and bitter. I wish they would just leave us all alone!


3
I view the gods as worthy adversaries-incredibly clever and well-prepared to play a long game but ultimately doomed to lose their games.


4
I'm certain every bad thing that happens can ultimately be blamed on the gods, but I roll my eyes at each new twist of fate and try to get on with my life.


5
I wish that I could be as naive as humans and other mortals who actually think the gods are looking out for them. I miss that kind of innocence.


6
I don't talk about it among other leonin, but I actually revere the gods and try to please them by my actions.
