Characteristic


1
Flowers are the most amazing things ever. I want to pick them, wear them, and discover their silent secrets.


2
There isn't a tree or statue that isn't fun to climb.


3
Nothing wards off bad luck like a jolly dance.


4
Sometimes talking to a plant really helps.


5
If stumped, I smoke a pipe. And if I'm going to smoke a pipe, it's going to be a splendid pipe.


6
I imagine that my clothes are my glorious soul on display for all the world to behold, and I dress accordingly.


7
Having horns is the best. They are fun to decorate, and they can pop open an amphora, no problem.


8
If I have something really important to say, I always make sure to sing it.
